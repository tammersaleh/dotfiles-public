This is a standard Ruby codebase for a small project.

First, read the README file. 

Rules:

- Always present a plan before proceeding.
- Always write tests before you write the implementation.
- Always make sure the specs pass (by running `mise specs`) before declaring victory.
- Any comments marked `AGENT:` are for you.  Pay attention to them.
