  USAGE: $me BUCKET PATH [DIFF_OPTIONS...]

  Prints the diff of a file against the same file in the S3 bucket.  If given a
  directory, runs the diff against _all_ files in the bucket.  Currently only
  supports files in the / folder in the S3 bucket.

  Obviously, this requires valid AWS credentials.  The suggested way is using
  https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault.

  Examples:

    $me s3://my_bucket my_file.yml       # Diffs a single file
    $me s3://my_bucket my_file.yml -q    # Diffs a single file. Passes -q to the diff command.
    $me s3://my_bucket .                 # Diffs all files in this directory
	EOF
  exit 1
